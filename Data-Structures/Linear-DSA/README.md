# Linear Data Structures in Javascript

A linear data structure has data elements connected to each other so that elements are arranged in a sequential manner and each element is connected to the element in front of it and behind it. This way, the structure can be traversed in a single run.

Linear data structures can be implemented easily as computer memory is also arranged in a linear manner. There are four types of linear data structures:

1. [Array](https://github.com/sunnyyadav30/Data-Structure-and-algorithm-in-JS/tree/master/Data-Structures/Linear-DSA/Arrays)
2. [Linked list](https://github.com/sunnyyadav30/Data-Structure-and-algorithm-in-JS/tree/master/Data-Structures/Linear-DSA/Linked-list)
3. [Queue](https://github.com/sunnyyadav30/Data-Structure-and-algorithm-in-JS/tree/master/Data-Structures/Linear-DSA/Queue)
4. [Stack](https://github.com/sunnyyadav30/Data-Structure-and-algorithm-in-JS/tree/master/Data-Structures/Linear-DSA/Stack)
